# Bike sales data
A comprehensive look at bike sales data spanning from 2016 - 2018 from various datasets, joined using MSSQL, and visualised using Tableau. The idea was to be able to look at sales data and really gather quantitative insights about the different aspects of the sales processes. The interactive dashboard can be found on Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeSales_17234869931850/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
